Whether its Babe Ruth or Larry Bird or Wayne Gretzky, the likelihood that legendary player cards will increase in value over time is generally higher than new players who still have a long, volatile career ahead of them. Read the Tyler Herro story below to see how young hype can quickly crash. In a bear market for cards, its safer to hold legendary players like Babe Ruth."}

These cards were all submitted for grading very recently as the trading card market has boomed.

While it's easy to get caught up in young NBA talent, the supply of their graded cards will likely increase once PSA eventually gets through their backlog. There's a greater risk of dilution in the value of younger cards as an increase in a specific card's supply results in a decrease in price."}
