Over the last six months alone, competitors like OpenSea, SuperRare, and Bitski have also raised sizable rounds of funding. Differentiation will become increasingly important. Rarible has also announced a new partnership with Flow blockchain, which was created by Dapper Labs and is currently used as the underlying technology behind NBA Top Shot. Right now, Rarible has lower volume than the market leader OpenSea. By partnering with Flow (and by association, NBA Top Shot), Rarible might be able to unlock a strategic advantage."}

Oddly enough, the co-founders are now tangled in a lawsuit regarding the sale of an NFT. Roc-A-Fella alleges that Dame Dash was about to sell an NFT of Jay-Z's 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt on the NFT platform SuperFarm. An online auction of the album was scheduled to take place on June 23, but was then cancelled since Roc-A-Fella took legal action against Dash. Roc-A-Fella pointed out that the auction claimed to completely transfer the album's copyright and all future revenue generated by the album from Damon Dash to the auction winner. The critical line from Roc-A-Fella's legal filing was \"Dash can't sell what he doesn't own.\""}
